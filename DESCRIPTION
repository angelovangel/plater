Description: Tools for interacting with data in the form of microtiter plates.
    plateR defines a simple, plate-shaped file format for data storage, so it's 
    easy to remember the experimental design, and provides functions to 
    seamlessly convert between that format and a tidy data frame that's optimal 
    for analysis.
